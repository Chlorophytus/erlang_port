# erlang_port

A library to ease the process of writing Erlang/Elixir ports using Rust.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need a copy of Rust installed.  Erlang, Elixir or another BEAM VM
would also be useful, as this library is meant to interact with them.
Installing these is outside the scope of this document though, so look
elsewhere for instructions for that.

### Installing

Add erlang_port to your `Cargo.toml`

```
erlang_port = "0"
```

## Running the tests

```
cargo test
```

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see `CHANGELOG.md`
